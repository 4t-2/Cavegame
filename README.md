# sup - please read before using or looking at code

This code right now is a mess and some of the libraries its using are completely custom and havent even been pushed to github yet
Im rewriting the AGL graphics library im using so a lot will change and its best to wait later before you go ahead compiling the code
Executable downloads can be found on my itchio page
