Thanks for downloading THE CAVEGAME (a name i totally own)

You may notice that when starting the game it crashes and doesnt work
(if the game is saying a dll cant be found then that is a seperate issue and report the bug on discord)

To get this working you need a copy of minecraft

1) Go to your .minecraft folder
	this can be found by doing win+r and pasting in this command (without quotes) "%appdata%\.minecraft"
	if on linux it is in ~/.minecraft
2) go to versions
3) then select a version you would like to extract assets from (if the one you want doesnt show up then you need to go to the launcher and download it there)
4) copy jar file and make the duplicate called whatever.zip
5) unzip the zip file
6) then go inside and look for the assets folder
7) next copy the folder called "minecraft"
8) in the cavegame folder go to resources then java then assets (the folder should contain a file called PUT MC ASSETS HERE)
9) paste the minecraft folder
10) Start the game

This is in very early pre-pre-testing-alpha so dont expect much polish though ill be giving this many frequent small updates to patch bugs and adding QOL features

In a later update there will be an auto extractor to do the steps above for you
